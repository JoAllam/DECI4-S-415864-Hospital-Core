# Hospital Core

## Overview
Hospital Core is a full-stack hospital management platform developed as a mono-repository. It demonstrates a modern healthcare application using React, Express, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD automation, cloud deployment, and automated testing.

## Known Deployment Note

> **Netlify Accessibility**
>
> During testing, the deployed frontend on Netlify may not be accessible from some networks or regions (including my local network in Egypt), where the browser returns *"This site can't be reached"*.
>
> The application itself is deployed correctly and can be accessed successfully from other networks. For demonstration purposes, I used a VPN when accessing the Netlify deployment from my location. The backend APIs hosted on Vercel remain accessible independently.
>
> If the Netlify deployment cannot be reached from your network, the project can also be run locally using the setup instructions provided above.
